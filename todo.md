# APA Template
I've developed this Word file to make it easier to prepare journal articles
that require subission in Word format and APA style.
It's a work in progress and I may add additional styles and features over time.

* Heading 1
* Heading 2
* Body Text
* Reference


# Response to reviewiers
`response-to-reviewers.docx` is a template with styles that I use when
resubmitting a manuscript following a revise and resubmit decision.
The template has styles for organising reviewer comments, responses, and quoting
changes. See the document for comments on the styles that I use.


# Accepted version template
`accepted-version.dotx` is a template for converting submitted manuscripts into
a more reader-friendly style for sharing on institutional repositories.

# Working notes
`working-notes.docx` is a template for workings. For every project that I am
working on I have a workings-file. It is similar to a lab book used in some
physical sciences. I use it for many things including: (a) brainstorming
structure, (b) recording preliminary analyses, (c) making notes on readings that
might be incorporated into a paper, (d) brainstorming journal submission
strategies, etc. The page is designed to be as long as MS Word will allow. Thus,
there are fewer page breaks to interfere with the flow. And ultimately, the
document is not designed for printing. Heading 1 provides broad sections.
Heading 2 is numbered and designed for specific topics.
